## Overview

The registration process in the Pixel Genius API is a two-step process involving OTP verification. This ensures secure account creation by requiring users to verify their email before completing registration.

**Base URL:** `/accounts/`

## Registration Flow

The registration process involves two steps:

1. **Initiate Registration:** User provides their email and password to request an OTP.
2. **Complete Registration:** User submits the OTP to finalize account creation.

## Flow Summary

1. **Initiate Registration:** Call `/accounts/register/initiate/` with email and password to generate an OTP.
2. **Complete Registration:** Use `/accounts/register/complete/` with the same email, password, and the received OTP to complete the registration.

## Notes for Frontend Developers

- **Sequential Steps:** Ensure the user completes the initiate step before proceeding to the complete step.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors such as invalid OTPs or already-registered emails gracefully to guide the user.
- **Retry Limitations:** Be mindful of any OTP resend limitations set on the backend.
