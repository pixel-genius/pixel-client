- **Pagination**: All list endpoints return paginated results by default. You can control the number of items per page by using the `page_size` query parameter (e.g., `/api/skills/?page_size=20`).
- **Authorization**: For POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests, ensure the user has admin privileges; otherwise, the API will return a 403 error.
